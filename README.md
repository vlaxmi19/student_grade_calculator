Creating a Java program that takes marks obtained in multiple subjects, calculates the total marks, average percentage, assigns a grade based on the average percentage, and displays the results to the user.
1-Input Number of Subjects: The program first prompts the user to enter the number of subjects.
2-Input Marks: It then uses a loop to take input for the marks obtained in each subject. The program validates the input to ensure that the marks are between 0 and 100.
3-Calculate Total Marks: As the user inputs the marks, the program sums them up to calculate the total marks.
4-Calculate Average Percentage: The average percentage is calculated by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.
5-Grade Calculation: Based on the average percentage, the program assigns a grade:
A: 90% and above
B: 80% to 89%
C: 70% to 79%
D: 60% to 69%
F: Below 60%
6-Display Results: Finally, the program displays the total marks, average percentage (formatted to two decimal places), and the corresponding grade.
